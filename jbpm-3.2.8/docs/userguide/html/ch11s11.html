    as identity management. jBPM includes an optional identity component 
    that can be easily replaced by a company's own identity data store.
    </p><p>The jBPM identity management component 
    includes knowledge of the organisational model.
    Task assignment is typically done with organisational knowledge. 
    So this implies knowledge of an organisational model, describing the 
    users, groups, systems and the relations between them.  Optionally, 
    permissions and roles can be included too in an organisational model.
    Various academic research attempts failed, proving that no generic 
    organisational model can be created that fits every organisation.
    </p><p>The way jBPM handles this is by defining an actor as an actual 
    participant in a process.  An actor is identified by its ID called an 
    actorId.  jBPM has only knowledge about actorId's and they are represented 
    as <code class="literal">java.lang.String</code>s for maximum flexibility. So any 
    knowledge about the organisational model and the structure of that data 
    is outside the scope of the jBPM core engine.</p><p>As an extension to jBPM we will provide (in the future) a component 
    to manage that simple user-roles model.   This many to many relation between 
    users and roles is the same model as is defined in the J2EE and the servlet 
    specs and it could serve as a starting point in new developments.  People 
    interested in contributing should check the jboss jbpm jira issue tracker
    for more details.</p><p>Note that the user-roles model as it is used in the servlet, ejb and 
    portlet specifications, is not sufficiently powerful for handling 
    task assignments.  That model is a many-to-many relation between
    users and roles.  This doesn't include information about the teams and 
    the organisational structure of users involved in a process.</p><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="theidentitymodel"></a>The identity model</h3></div></div></div><div class="figure"><a name="identity.model.image"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;11.3.&nbsp;The identity model class diagram</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/identity.model.gif" align="middle" alt="The identity model class diagram"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The classes in yellow are the relevant classes for the expression

      <code class="literal">Group</code> is any kind of group of users.  
      Groups can be nested to model the relation 
      between a team, a business unit and the whole company.  Groups have 
      a type to differentiate between the hierarchical groups and e.g. 
      haircolor groups. <code class="literal">Membership</code>s represent the 
      many-to-many relation between users and groups.  A membership can be 
      used to represent a position in a company.  The name of the membership 
      can be used to indicate the role that the user fullfills in the 
      group.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="assignmentexpressions"></a>Assignment expressions</h3></div></div></div><p>The identity component comes with one implementation that evaluates an
      expression for the calculation of actors during assignment of tasks. Here's
      an example of using the assignment expression in a process definition:</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;process-definition&gt;
  ...
  &lt;task-node name='a'&gt;
    &lt;task name='laundry'&gt;
      &lt;assignment expression='previous --&gt; group(hierarchy) --&gt; member(boss)' /&gt;
    &lt;/task&gt;
    &lt;transition to='b' /&gt;
  &lt;/task-node&gt;
  ...</pre><p>Syntax of the assignment expression is like this:</p><pre class="programlisting">first-term --&gt; next-term --&gt; next-term --&gt; ... --&gt; next-term

where

first-term ::= previous |
               swimlane(swimlane-name) |
               variable(variable-name) |
               user(user-name) |
               group(group-name)

and 

next-term ::= group(group-type) |
              member(role-name)
</pre><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="firstterms"></a>First terms</h4></div></div></div><p>An expression is resolved from left to right.  The first-term specifies 
        a <code class="literal">User</code> or <code class="literal">Group</code> in the identity model.  
        Subsequent terms calculate the next term from the intermediate user or 
        group.</p><p><code class="literal">previous</code> means the task is assigned to the current 
        authenticated actor.  This means the actor that performed the previous step in 
        the process.</p><p><code class="literal">swimlane(swimlane-name)</code> means the user or group is taken 
        from the specified swimlane instance.</p><p><code class="literal">variable(variable-name)</code> means the user or group is taken 
        from the specified variable instance.  The variable instance can contain a 
        <code class="literal">java.lang.String</code>, in which case that user or group is fetched from 
        the identity component.  Or the variable instance contains a <code class="literal">User</code> 
        or <code class="literal">Group</code> object. </p><p><code class="literal">user(user-name)</code> means the given user is taken from the 
        identity component.</p><p><code class="literal">group(group-name)</code> means the given group is taken from the 
        identity component.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="nextterms"></a>Next terms</h4></div></div></div><p><code class="literal">group(group-type)</code> gets the group for a user.  Meaning that 
        previous terms must have resulted in a <code class="literal">User</code>.  It searches for the 
        the group with the given group-type in all the memberships for the user.</p><p><code class="literal">member(role-name)</code> gets the user that performs a given role 
        for a group.  The previous terms must have resulted in a <code class="literal">Group</code>.  
        This term searches for the user with a membership to the group for which the name 
        of the membership matches the given role-name.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="removingtheidentitycomponent"></a>Removing the identity component</h3></div></div></div><p>When you want to use your own datasource for organisational
