A <code class="literal">task-node</code> 
    contains zero or more tasks.  Tasks are a static description as part of the process 
    definition.  At runtime, tasks result in the creation of task instances.  A task 
    instance corresponds to one entry in a person's task list.</p><p>With jBPM, <a href="ch11s03.html#thepersonaltasklist" title="The personal task list">push (personal task list)</a> and 
    <a href="ch11s03.html#thegrouptasklist" title="The group task list">pull (group task list)</a> model (see below) of 
    task assignment can be applied in combination.  
    The process can calculate the responsible for a task and push it in his/her tasklist.
    Or alternatively, a task can be assigned to a pool of actors, in which case 
    each of the actors in the pool can pull the task and put it in the actor's 
    personal tasklist.
    </p><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="assignmentinterfaces"></a>Assignment interfaces</h3></div></div></div><p>Assigning task instances is done via the interface 
      <code class="literal">AssignmentHandler</code>:</p><pre class="programlisting">public interface AssignmentHandler extends Serializable {
  void assign( Assignable assignable, ExecutionContext executionContext );
}</pre><p>An assignment handler implementation is called when a task instance is 
      created.  At that time, the task instance can be assigned to one or more actors.  
      The <code class="literal">AssignmentHandler</code> implementation should 
      call the <code class="literal">Assignable</code> methods (<code class="literal">setActorId</code> or 
      <code class="literal">setPooledActors</code>) to assign a task.  The <code class="literal">Assignable</code> is either 
      a <code class="literal">TaskInstance</code> or a <code class="literal">SwimlaneInstance</code> (=process role).
      </p><pre class="programlisting">public interface Assignable {
  public void setActorId(String actorId);
  public void setPooledActors(String[] pooledActors);
}</pre><p>Both <code class="literal">TaskInstance</code>s
      and <code class="literal">SwimlaneInstance</code>s can be assigned to a specific user or to a pool 
      of actors.  To assign a TaskInstance to a user, call 
      <code class="literal">Assignable.setActorId(String actorId)</code>. To assign a TaskInstance to a pool
      of candidate actors, call <code class="literal">Assignable.setPooledActors(String[] actorIds)</code>.
      </p><p>Each task in the process definition can be associated with an assignment
      handler implementation to perform the assignment at runtime.</p><p>When more than one task in a process should be assigned to the same person 
      or group of actors, consider the usage of a <a href="ch11s06.html" title="Swimlanes">swimlane</a></p><p>To allow for the creation of reusable <code class="literal">AssignmentHandler</code>s,
      each usage of an <code class="literal">AssignmentHandler</code> can be configured in 
      the <code class="literal">processdefinition.xml</code>.  See <a href="ch17s02.html" title="Delegation">the section called &#8220;Delegation&#8221;</a> 
      for more information on how to add configuration to assignment handlers.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="theassignmentdatamodel"></a>The assignment data model</h3></div></div></div><p>The datamodel for managing assignments of task instances and swimlane instances to 
      actors is the following.  Each <code class="literal">TaskInstance</code> has an actorId
      and a set of pooled actors.</p><div class="figure"><a name="assignment.model.image"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;11.1.&nbsp;The assignment model class diagram</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/assignment.model.gif" align="middle" alt="The assignment model class diagram"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The actorId is the responsible for the task, while the 
      set of pooled actors represents a collection of candidates that can become responsible 
      if they would take the task.  Both actorId and pooledActors are optional and can 
      also be combined.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="thepersonaltasklist"></a>The personal task list</h3></div></div></div><p>The personal task list denotes all the task instances that are assigned to a specific individual.
      This is indicated with the property <code class="literal">actorId</code> on a <code class="literal">TaskInstance</code>.  So 
      to put a TaskInstance in someone's personal task list, you just use one of the following ways:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>Specify an expression in the attribute <code class="literal">actor-id</code> of the task element in the process</li><li>Use TaskInstance.setActorId(String) from anywhere in your code</li><li>Use assignable.setActorId(String) in an AssignmentHandler</li></ul></div><p>To fetch the personal task list for a given user, use <code class="literal">TaskMgmtSession.findTaskInstances(String actorId)</code>.
      </p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="thegrouptasklist"></a>The group task list</h3></div></div></div><p>The pooled actors denote the candidates for the task instance. This means that the task is offered to many users 
      and one candidate has to step up and take the task.  Users can not start working on tasks in their group task list 
      immediately.  That would result in a potential conflict that many people start working on the same task.  To prevent this,
      users can only take task instances of their group task list and move them into their personal task list.  Users are only 
      allowed to start working on tasks that are in their personal task list.
      </p><p>To put a taskInstance in someone's group task list, you must put the user's actorId or one of the user's 
      groupIds in the pooledActorIds.  So specify the pooled actors, use one of the following:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>Specify an expression in the attribute <code class="literal">pooled-actor-ids</code> of the task element in the process</li><li>Use TaskInstance.setPooledActorIds(String[]) from anywhere in your code</li><li>Use assignable.setPooledActorIds(String[]) in an AssignmentHandler</li></ul></div><p>To fetch the group task list for a given user, proceed as follows: Make a collection that includes the user's actorId 
      and all the ids of groups that the user belongs to. With <code class="literal">TaskMgmtSession.findPooledTaskInstances(String actorId)</code> or
      <code class="literal">TaskMgmtSession.findPooledTaskInstances(List actorIds)</code> you can search for task instances that are not in a personal 
      task list (actorId==null) and for which there is a match in the pooled actorIds.  
      </p><p>The motivation behind this is that we want to separate the identity component from jBPM task assignment. jBPM only stores 
      Strings as actorIds and doesn't know the relation between the users, groups and other identity information.
      </p><p>The actorId will always override the pooled actors.  So a taskInstance that has an actorId and a list of pooledActorIds,
      will only show up in the actor's personal task list.  Keeping the pooledActorIds around allows a user to put a task instance
      back into the group by just setting the actorId property of the taskInstance to <code class="literal">null</code>.
