    process definition and the chain of command pattern.</p><p>Interpretation of the process definition means that the process 
    definition data is stored in the database.  At runtime the process definition 
    information is used during process execution.  Note for the concerned : 
    we use hibernate's second level cache to avoid loading of definition information 
    at runtime.  Since the process definitions don't change (see process versioning)
    hibernate can cache the process definitions in memory.</p><p>The chain of command pattern means that each node in the graph is 
    responsible for propagating the process execution.  If a node does not 
    propagate execution, it behaves as a wait state.</p><p>The idea is to start execution on process instances and that the execution 
    continues till it enters a wait state.</p><p>A token represents a path of execution.  A token has a pointer to a node 
    in the process graph.  During waitstates, the tokens can be persisted 
    in the database.  Now we are going to look at the algorithm for calculating the 
    execution of a token.  Execution starts when a signal is sent to a token.
    The execution is then passed over the transitions and nodes via the chain of 
    command pattern. These are the relevant methods in a class diagram.</p><div class="figure"><a name="graph.execution.image"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;9.4.&nbsp;The graph execution related methods</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/graph.execution.gif" align="middle" alt="The graph execution related methods"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>When a token is in a node, signals can be sent to the token.  Sending a 
    signal is an instruction to start execution.  A signal must therefore specify 
    a leaving transition of the token's current node.  The first transition is the 
    default.  In a signal to a token, the token takes its current node 
    and calls the <code class="literal">Node.leave(ExecutionContext,Transition)</code> method.  Think 
    of the ExecutionContext as a Token because the main object in an ExecutionContext 
    is a Token.  The <code class="literal">Node.leave(ExecutionContext,Transition)</code> method will 
    fire the <code class="literal">node-leave</code> event and call the 
    <code class="literal">Transition.take(ExecutionContext)</code>.  That method will fire 
	the <code class="literal">transition</code> event and call the 
    <code class="literal">Node.enter(ExecutionContext)</code> on the destination node of the
    transition.  That method will fire the <code class="literal">node-enter</code> event and 
    call the <code class="literal">Node.execute(ExecutionContext)</code>.  Each type of node 
    has its own behaviour that is implementated in the execute method.  Each node 
    is responsible for propagating graph execution by calling the 
    <code class="literal">Node.leave(ExecutionContext,Transition)</code> again. In summary:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>Token.signal(Transition)</li><li>--&gt; Node.leave(ExecutionContext,Transition)</li><li>--&gt; Transition.take(ExecutionContext)</li><li>--&gt; Node.enter(ExecutionContext)</li><li>--&gt; Node.execute(ExecutionContext)</li></ul></div><p>Note that the complete calculation of the next state, including the invocation 
    of the actions is done in the thread of the client.  A common misconception is that 
    all calculations *must* be done in the thread of the client.  As with any asynchronous 
    invocation, you can use asynchronous messaging (JMS) for that.   When the message is 
    sent in the same transaction as the process instance update, all synchronization issues 
    are taken care of.  Some workflow systems use asynchronous messaging between all nodes 
    in the graph.  But in high throughput environments, this algorithm gives much more control 
    and flexibility for tweaking performance of a business process.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch09s09.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch09.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch09s11.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Custom node behaviour&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Transaction demarcation</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
