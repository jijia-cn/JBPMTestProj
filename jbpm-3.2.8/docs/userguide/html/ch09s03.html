For more information about the 
    graph and its executional model, refer to <a href="">???</a>.
    </p><p>Each node has a specific type.  The node type determines what will happen when 
    an execution arrives in the node at runtime.  jBPM has a set of preimplemented node types 
    that you can use.  Alternatively, you can write custom code for implementing your own specific 
    node behaviour.</p><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="noderesponsibilities"></a>Node responsibilities</h3></div></div></div><p>Each node has 2 main responsibilities: First, it can execute plain java code. 
      Typically the plain java code relates to the function of the node.  E.g. creating a 
      few task instances, sending a notification, updating a database,...  Secondly, a node 
      is responsible for propagating the process execution.  Basically, each node has the 
      following options for propagating the process execution:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><span class="bold"><strong>1. not propagate the execution.</strong></span>  In that 
        case the node behaves as a wait state.</li><li><span class="bold"><strong>2. propagate the execution over one of the leaving 
        transitions of the node.</strong></span>  This means that the token that originally 
        arrived in the node is passed over one of the leaving transitions with the API call
        executionContext.leaveNode(String).  The node will now act as an automatic node in the 
        sense it can execute some custom programming logic and then continue process execution 
        automatically without waiting.</li><li><span class="bold"><strong>3. create new paths of execution.</strong></span> A node can
        decide to create new tokens.  Each new token represents a new path of execution and 
        each new token can be launched over the node's leaving transitions. A good example of 
        this kind of behaviour is the fork node.</li><li><span class="bold"><strong>4. end paths of execution.</strong></span> A node can decide
        to end a path of execution. That means that the token is ended and the path of execution
        is finished.</li><li><span class="bold"><strong>5. more general, a node can modify the whole runtime 
        structure of the process instance.</strong></span>  The runtime structure is a process instance 
        that contains a tree of tokens.  Each token represents a path of execution.  A node can 
        create and end tokens, put each token in a node of the graph and launch tokens over 
        transitions.</li></ul></div><p>jBPM contains --as any workflow and BPM engine-- a set of preimplemented node types
      that have a specific documented configuration and behaviour.  But the unique thing about 
      jBPM and the <a href="">Graph Oriented Programming foundation</a>
      is that we open up the model for developers.  Developers can write their own node behaviour
      very easy and use it in a process.
      </p><p>That is where traditional workflow and BPM systems are
      much more closed.  They usually supply a fixed set of node types (called the process language).
      Their process language is closed and the executional model is hidden in the runtime 
      environment.  Research of <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="http://www.workflowpatterns.com" target="_top">workflow patterns</a>
      has shown that any process language is not powerfull enough.  We have decided for a simple 
      model and allow developers to write their own node types.  That way the JPDL process language 
      is open ended.</p><p>Next, we discuss the most important node types of JPDL.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="nodetypetasknode"></a>Nodetype task-node</h3></div></div></div><p>A task node represents one or more tasks that are to be performed by humans.
      So when execution arrives in a task node, task instances will be created in the task 
      lists of the workflow participants.  After that, the node will behave as a wait state.
      So when the users perform their task, the task completion will trigger the resuming 
      of the execution. In other words, that leads to a new signal being called on the token.
      </p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="nodetypetaskstate"></a>Nodetype state</h3></div></div></div><p>A state is a bare-bones wait state.  The difference with a task node is that 
      no task instances will be created in any task list.  This can be usefull if the process 
      should wait for an external system.  E.g. upon entry of the node (via an action on the node-enter
      event), a message could be sent to the external system.  After that, the process will
      go into a wait state.  When the external system send a response message, this can lead to 
      a token.signal(), which triggers resuming of the process execution.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="nodetypedecision"></a>Nodetype decision</h3></div></div></div><p>Actually there are 2 ways to model a decision.  The distinction between the two 
      is based on *who* is making the decision.  Should the decision made by the process (read:
      specified in the process definition).  Or should an external entity provide the result of 
      the decision.</p><p>When the decision is to be taken by the process, a decision node should be used.
      There are basically 2 ways to specify the decision criteria.  Simplest is by adding 
      condition elements on the transitions.  Conditions are EL expressions or beanshell scripts
      that return a boolean.</p><p>At runtime the decision node will FIRST loop over its leaving transitions THAT HAVE 
      a condition specified.  It will evaluate those transitions first in 
      the order as specified in the xml.  The first transition for which the conditions resolves to 
      'true' will be taken.  If all transitions with a condition resolve to false, the default 
      transition (the first in the XML) is taken.</p><p>Another approach is to use an expression that returns the name 
      of the transition to take.  With the 'expression' attribute, you can specify an expression
      on the decision that has to resolve to one of the leaving transitions of the decision node.</p><p>Next aproach is the 'handler' element on the decision, that element can be used to specify
      an implementation of the DecisionHandler interface can be specified on the decision node.  Then the 
      decision is calculated in a java class and the selected leaving transition is returned by the decide-method 
      of the DecisionHandler implementation.</p><p>When the decision is taken by an external party (meaning: not part of the process 
      definition), you should use multiple transitions leaving a state or wait state node.
      Then the leaving transition can be provided in the external trigger that resumes execution
      after the wait state is finished.  E.g. <code class="literal">Token.signal(String transitionName)</code> 
      and <code class="literal">TaskInstance.end(String transitionName)</code>.
      </p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="nodetypefork"></a>Nodetype fork</h3></div></div></div><p>A fork splits one path of execution into multiple concurrent paths of execution.  The 
      default fork behaviour is to create a child token for each transition that leaves the fork,
      creating a parent-child relation between the token that arrives in the fork.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="nodetypejoin"></a>Nodetype join</h3></div></div></div><p>The default join assumes that all tokens that arrive in the join are children of the
      same parent.  This situation is created when using the fork as mentioned above and when all 
      tokens created by a fork arrive in the same join. A join will end every token that enters the 
      join.  Then the join will examine the parent-child relation of the token that enters the 
      join.  When all sibling tokens have arrived in the join, the parent token will be propagated 
      over the (unique!) leaving transition.  When there are still sibling tokens active, the join
      will behave as a wait state.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="nodetypenode"></a>Nodetype node</h3></div></div></div><p>The type node serves the situation where you want to write your own code in a node.
      The nodetype node expects one subelement action.  The action is executed when the execution
      arrives in the node.  The code you write in the actionhandler can do anything you want but 
      it is also <a href="ch09s03.html#noderesponsibilities" title="Node responsibilities">responsible for propagating the execution</a>.
      </p><p>This node can be used if you want to use a JavaAPI to implement some functional logic that 
      is important for the business analyst.  By using a node, the node is visible in the graphical
      representation of the process.  For comparison, actions --covered next-- will allow you to 
      add code that is invisible in the graphical representation of the process, in case that logic 
      is not important for the business analyst.
